{'content': 'On November 28, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission '
            'obtained a judgment against a penny stock promoter in connection '

            'On November 17, 2014, the SEC charged Jay Fung and two others '
            'with orchestrating schemes to manipulate five penny stocks '
            'between November 2009 and September 2010.  The complaint alleged '
            'that, as part of the manipulative scheme, Fung and the other '
            'defendants, through entities they controlled, acquired a '
            'significant amount of the publicly traded shares of the '
            'companies, distributed misleading newsletters to prospective '
            'investors touting the companies, and created demand for the '
            'stocks.  The complaint further alleged that the newsletters '
            'controlled by Fung, among other things, stated that they "may" or '
            '"might" sell the shares owned in the companies that were being '
            'touted when, in fact, they intended to sell, and in some cases '
            'were selling, the shares owned.\n'

            'violating the antifraud provision of Section 17(b) of the '
            'Securities Act of 1933.  The judgment provides that the amount of '
            'any disgorgement and civil monetary penalties to be imposed will '
            'be determined by the court at a later date.\n'
            'Fung previously settled charges in March 2016 relating to trading '
            'on inside information in advance of a pharmaceutical company '
            'merger.  Fung also settled charges in February 2014 relating to '
            'his role in a scheme in which he promoted a penny stock without '

            '     complaint alleges that between August 1993 and May 1994, '
            'Maury H. Joseph\r\n'

            '(Beni), Florida\r\n'
            '     West s former president, perpetrated a fraud on Florida West '
            's shareholders\r\n'
            '     and independent auditors by misrepresenting revenues and '
            'profits,\r\n'
            '     falsifying financial statements and by causing Florida West '

            '\r\n'
            '          Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on January 21, '
            '1994, Joseph\r\n'
            '     and Beni caused Florida West to issue a press release which '
            'falsely\r\n'
            '     represented that the Company expected to report profits of '
            'between $800,000\r\n'

            'employee to forge the\r\n'

            '\r\n'

            'false statements\r\n'

            'memorandum\r\n'

            'General Counsel of\r\n'
            '     Medaphis Corporation ("Medaphis"), an Atlanta-based medical '
            'services\r\n'
            '     company, was in possession of material non-public '
            'information regarding\r\n'
            '     search warrants that were executed by the Federal Bureau of '
            'Investigation\r\n'
            '     ("FBI") on two Medaphis offices in California.  In violation '
            'of her\r\n'
            '     fiduciary duty to Medaphis, the general counsel disclosed '
            'the information\r\n'
            '     about the FBI investigation to her mother and co-defendant '
            'Brenner.  Both\r\n'

            'complaint further\r\n'
            '     alleged that Brenner also disclosed the FBI action against '
            'Medaphis to his\r\n'
            '     father and brother, who promptly sold their shares of '
            'Medaphis stock.\r\n'

            '          On June 15, 1995 at the close of trading, Medaphis '
            'issued a public\r\n'
            '     announcement about the FBI investigation of Medaphis.  The '
            'price of\r\n'
            '     Medaphis stock dropped sharply the next day.  By selling '
            'their shares of\r\n'
            '     Medaphis stock prior to the announcement, Brenner, along '
            'with his father\r\n'

            'October 2002, Hobbs learned certain confidential information '
            'about the acquisition of the company.  Among other things, at '
            'least two Granite State employees who reported to Hobbs discussed '
            'with him unusual document requests they had received from Granite '
            'State executives that suggested due diligence was being performed '
            'on Granite State or that an acquisition involving Granite State '
            'was going to happen.  The complaint further alleges that Hobbs '
            'participated in discussions with other Granite State employees '
            'during this time period about the likelihood of an acquisition '
            'involving Granite State and heard numerous rumors among Granite '
            'State employees that an acquisition was taking place.  According '
            'to the complaint, the information that Hobbs obtained was '
            'material, nonpublic information available only to insiders at '
            'Granite State, and the information confirmed for Hobbs that '
            'Granite State was engaged in acquisition-related activity.  The '
            'complaint alleges that Hobbs tipped Mayhew, and that Hobbs '
            'purchased 10,030 shares of Granite State and Mayhew purchased '
            '4,700 shares of Granite State while they were in possession of '
            'inside information.\n'
            'The complaint alleges that Hobbs breached a duty to Granite State '
            'by purchasing shares of Granite State while in possession of '
            'material, nonpublic information and by tipping Mayhew, and that '
            'Mayhew knew that Hobbs worked at Granite State and knew, or was '
            'reckless in not knowing, that Hobbs was providing confidential '
            "information to him in breach of Hobbs' duty to Granite State.  In "
            'its complaint, the Commission charged Hobbs and Mayhew with '
            'violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 '
            "and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission's complaint seeks "

            'The Fund purports to raise capital from investors to make and '

            "Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, "
            'alleges that the Fund, Emvest, and Brock misrepresented and '
            'failed to disclose to potential and existing investors material '
            'information regarding the use of investor capital, investor '
            'returns, and the preservation of investor capital.\n'
            'Specifically, the complaint alleges that the Fund, Emvest, and '
            "Brock misrepresented that investors' capital would be used to "
            'make and purchase loans secured by real property.  Instead, the '
            "defendants used substantial amounts of new investors' capital to "
            "pay returns to existing investors and to cover the Fund's "
            'operating losses.  In addition, despite an explicit prohibition '
            "in the Fund's offering prospectus, the defendants used investor "
            "capital to pay finder's fees or commissions to a company "
            'affiliated with the Fund.  \n'
            "Additionally, the Commission's complaint alleges that the "
            'defendants represented that the Fund would pay investors a 12% '
            'return on their capital, but failed to disclose to investors that '
            'all or a substantial portion of their 12% return was funded with '
            'new investor capital.  The complaint also alleges that the '
            "defendants misrepresented that the Fund's investment objectives "
            "included preserving investors' capital, when they were actually "
            "decreasing investors' capital by distributing it as part of "
            'investor returns.  Since 2002, the Fund has raised approximately '
            '$18 million from 270 investors.\n'
            'The Court issued an order temporarily enjoining all of the '
            'defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of '

{'content': 'The Commission announced that, on October 25, 2004, a '
            'Massachusetts federal court, by consent, issued an order in an '
            'insider trading case enjoining Andrew S. Marks, of Wayland, '
            'Massachusetts, from violations of the antifraud provisions, and '
            'barring him from acting as an officer or director of a public '
            'company.  Marks was also ordered to pay $53,000 in disgorgement.  '
            'Marks is currently in federal prison serving a sentence of a year '
            'and a day as the result of a related criminal proceeding.\n'
            'In its complaint, filed December 3, 2002, the Commission alleged '
            "that Marks, who at the time was Vertex's highest-ranking "
            'attorney, learned on September 20, 2001, that Vertex planned to '
            'announce the suspension of clinical trials of one of its '
            "promising drugs on September 24.  According to the Commission's "
            'complaint, on September 21, Marks liquidated all of his Vertex '
            'stock despite having previously acknowledged in writing that the '
            'impending release would not be viewed favorably by Wall Street '
            'and that he should not sell his Vertex shares.  The Commission '
            "alleged that, by selling his holdings prior to the company's "
            'public announcement on September 24, Marks avoided a loss of '
            '$105,999.   \n'
            "According to the Commission's complaint, at the time he traded, "
            'Marks was the designated attorney for employees to consult '
            "regarding compliance with Vertex's employee securities trading "
            'policy.  In that capacity, the Commission alleged, Marks wrote '
            "Vertex's CEO an email on September 20, advising him to make sure "
            'that an employee who had requested permission to trade had no '
            'knowledge of the impending press release.  In the e-mail, Marks '
            'wrote:   \n'
            'I guess that I am troubled about any employee trading prior to '
            'that release because it is likely to have an effect on the stock '
            "(looks like I can't sell any shares) and, depending on the degree "
            'of that effect, could create the perception of insider trading. \n'
            'On September 21, less than 24 hours after writing this email to '
            'the CEO, the Commission alleged, Marks sold 20,900 shares of '
            'Vertex at an average price of $22.81 per share, receiving '
            '$476,765.  Vertex announced its decision to terminate clinical '
            "trials at approximately 7:10 a.m. on September 24.  Vertex's "
            'shares closed that day at $17.74, down $5.33 from the previous '
            'close on volume of 9.8 million shares, more than eight times '
            'average daily volume. \n'
            'In its complaint, the Commission alleged that Marks traded in '
            'breach of a fiduciary duty to Vertex and its shareholders not to '
            "trade in the company's stock while in possession of material, "
            'nonpublic information about the company.  As a result of the '
            'conduct described in the complaint, the Commission charged Marks '
            'with violations of the antifraud provisions of federal securities '
            'laws, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and '
            'Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of '
            '1933.  The order holds Marks liable for disgorgement of $105,999, '
            "the full amount sought in the Commission's complaint, but waives "
            'payment of all but $53,000 based on sworn financial information '
            'that Marks submitted to the Commission.  In addition, pursuant to '
            'an ancillary Commission administrative proceeding, Marks has been '
            'suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission '
            "under Rule 102(e)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice.\n"
            'On October 3, 2003, in the related criminal action, Marks had '
            'pled guilty to a one-count information filed by the U.S. Attorney '
            'for the District of Massachusetts charging him with unlawful '
            'insider trading in connection with his sale of Vertex stock.  On '
            'January 12, 2004, a federal judge sentenced Marks to a year and a '

            'On December 10, 2002, the Commission filed two settled '
            'enforcement proceedings charging Syncor International '
            'Corporation, a radiopharmaceutical company based in Woodland '
            'Hills, California, with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices '
            'Act (FCPA).  First, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the United '
            'States District Court for the District of Columbia charging '
            'Syncor with violating the FCPA and seeking a civil penalty.  '
            'Second, the Commission issued an administrative order finding '
            'that Syncor violated the anti-bribery, books-and-records, and '
            'internal-controls provisions of the FCPA, ordering Syncor to '
            'cease and desist from such violations, and requiring Syncor to '
            'retain an independent consultant to review and make '
            "recommendations concerning the company's FCPA compliance policies "
            "and procedures.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's "
            'charges, Syncor consented to the entry of a final judgment in the '
            'federal lawsuit requiring it to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and '
            "consented to the Commission's issuance of its administrative "
            'order.\n'
            '\n'
            'In both its federal court complaint and its administrative order, '
            'the Commission charged that, from at least the mid-1980s through '
            "at least September 2002, Syncor's foreign subsidiaries in Taiwan, "
            'Mexico, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France made a total of at least '
            '$600,000 in illicit payments to doctors employed by hospitals '
            'controlled by foreign authorities.  According to the Commission, '
            'these illicit payments were made with the purpose and effect of '
            "influencing the doctors' decisions so that Syncor could obtain or "
            'retain business with them and the hospitals that employed them.  '
            'The Commission charged, moreover, that the payments were made '
            'with the knowledge and approval of senior officers of the '
            'relevant Syncor subsidiaries, and in some cases with the '
            "knowledge and approval of Syncor's founder and chairman of the "
            'board.\n'
            '\n'
            'According to the Commission, by making these payments through its '
            'subsidiaries, Syncor violated the anti-bribery provisions of the '
            'FCPA (Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  The '
            'Commission further charged that, by improperly recording these '
            'payments - and similar payments made to foreign persons not '
            'affiliated with government-owned facilities - Syncor violated the '
            'books-and-records provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of '
            'the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Finally, the Commission '
            'charged that, by failing to devise or maintain an effective '
            'system of internal controls to prevent or detect these violations '
            'of the FCPA, Syncor violated the internal accounting controls '
            'provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities '
            'Exchange Act of 1934).\n'
            '\n'
            "In determining to accept Syncor's settlement offer, the "
            'Commission considered the full cooperation that Syncor provided '
            'to the Commission staff during its investigation.  The Commission '
            'also considered the fact that Syncor - after being alerted to the '
            'relevant conduct by another company that was conducting due '
            'diligence relating to a previously announced merger with Syncor - '

            'has filed a First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Other '
            'Equitable Relief ("Amended Complaint") in the above matter to add '
            'allegations of fraud against Defendant Andrew K. Lech ("Lech").  '
            'The Court has also entered, pursuant to his consent, an order of '
            'Final Judgment and Order of Disgorgement against Defendant Gary '
            'L. McNaughton, individually and d/b/a The Haven Equity Company '
            '("McNaughton").\n'
            'According to the Amended Complaint, from at least 1999 to June '
            '2003, McNaughton raised at least $17 million from approximately '
            '150 investors through the unregistered offer and sale of '
            'securities in the form of notes issued under the name of The '
            'Haven Equity Company. The Amended Complaint alleges that in '
            'selling these notes, McNaughton fraudulently guaranteed an annual '
            'return of 15% to 20% on a principal investment.  McNaughton told '
            'investors that they would receive their returns in the form of '
            'monthly interest payments.  The Amended Complaint alleges that '
            'McNaughton told investors that he would send their money to his '
            'wealthy childhood friend, Lech, who was supposed to use his '
            'expertise in options trading to generate the guaranteed returns.  '
            'The Amended Complaint also alleges that although McNaughton told '
            'Lech that he was sending him Haven Equity investor funds, Lech '
            'did not invest the funds.  Rather, Lech merely sent the '
            "investors' funds back to McNaughton who used them to pay other "
            'investors their monthly interest.  According to the Amended '
            'Complaint, Lech knew that because the funds solicited from '
            'investors were not invested, it was impossible to realize the '
            'guaranteed returns. \n'
            'According to the Amended Complaint, McNaughton and Lech also '
            'perpetuated the Haven Equity scheme by convincing investors to '
            'transfer their investment to Lech who offered his own notes '
            '("Lech notes").  Under the Lech notes, Lech personally guaranteed '
            'Haven Equity investors their principal and interest.  However, '
            'investors who executed Lech notes neither received their returns '
            'as guaranteed nor were repaid their principal.  The Amended '
            'Complaint also alleges that Lech lacked the financial resources '
            'to fulfill the notes he guaranteed.  Moreover, Lech used funds '
            'from bank accounts into which investor funds were deposited to '
            'pay numerous personal expenses.  The Amended Complaint adds '
            'allegations of fraud against Lech based on his involvement in the '
            'scheme and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of '
            'ill-gotten gains and a civil penalty against him.  The previous '
            'orders against Lech based on his unregistered offer and sale of '
            'securities, including an order freezing assets, remain in '
            'effect.  \n'
            'On August 23, 2004, the Commission obtained, pursuant to '
            "McNaughton's consent, a Final Judgment and Order of Disgorgement "
            'which ordered that McNaughton was liable for disgorgement plus '
            'prejudgment interest of $6,228,351, representing profits he '
            'gained from his scheme.  The Final Judgment required McNaughton '
            'to pay $11,815.24 and waived the remainder of the disgorgement '
            'based on his sworn financial statement which showed that he could '
            "not pay more.  McNaughton's obligation to pay $11,815.24 will be "
            'satisfied by the same amount of funds currently frozen in a '
            'securities account belonging to Gary McNaughton.  \n'

{'content': 'On October 11, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission '
            '("Commission") filed a settled civil action in the United States '
            'District Court for the Southern District of New York against '
            'Steven B. Markovitz, a former trader at Millennium Partners, L.P. '
            '("Millennium"), a New York-based hedge fund. In October 2003, the '
            'Commission instituted partially settled administrative and '
            'cease-and-desist proceedings against Markovitz based on his late '
            'trading of mutual funds at Millennium. At that time, the '
            "Commission issued an order, with Markovitz's consent, barring him "
            'from associating with an investment adviser. \n'
            "The Commission's complaint alleges that Markovitz violated the "
            "Commission's bar order. From November 2004 to May 2006, "
            'Markovitz, with two unnamed individuals, formed an offshore '
            'investment adviser, and proceeded to conduct the business of the '
            'investment adviser, including communicating and meeting with '
            'investors and prospective investors and placing buy and sell '
            "orders, from New York City, in violation of the Commission's "
            'investment adviser bar. Through this conduct, Markovitz willfully '
            'and intentionally violated (i) the order barring him from '
            'association with an investment adviser and (ii) Section 203(f) of '
            'the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which prohibits persons '
            'subject to investment adviser bars from violating those bars. \n'
            "Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, "
            'Markovitz has consented to the entry of a final judgment '
            'permanently enjoining him from violating certain orders issued in '
            "the Commission's administrative proceeding and Section 203(f) of "
            'the Investment Advisers Act and ordering him to disgorge $50,000 '
            'and pay a civil penalty of $120,000. \n'
            'Today, the Commission also issued an order, on consent, in its '
            'administrative proceeding against Markovitz that requires him to '
            'disgorge $1 and pay a $400,000 civil penalty for his late trading '
            'conduct. From 1999 to 2003, while employed as a hedge fund trader '
            'at Millennium, Markovitz engaged in late trading on behalf of '
            'Millennium. Late trading violates the federal securities laws '
            'related to the price at which mutual fund shares must be bought '
            'or sold and defrauds innocent investors in those mutual funds by '
            'giving to the late trader an advantage not available to other '
            'investors. Markovitz consented to the issuance of the '
            'administrative order without admitting or denying the findings '
            'therein. \n'

            'company, using spam email. The couple pocketed more than $1 '
            'million in proceeds as a result of the scam. \n'
            "The Commission's complaint alleges that Jeffery Steven Stone of "
            'Greenwich, Connecticut, and his wife, Janette Diller Stone, using '
            'entities they controlled, acquired massive amounts of WebSky '
            'stock under false pretenses, hired stock promoters to hype the '
            'stock in false spam emails, and then dumped their shares into the '

            'distributing shares to the public. Within days, the two began '
            'selling the shares to third parties. Stone and Diller also '
            'engineered a spam email campaign that falsely portrayed WebSky - '
            'a start-up Internet company with virtually no revenues or profits '
            '- as having a successful joint venture in Argentina that would '
            'result in over $40 million in annual revenues. In reality, '

            'almost 20 times greater than normal, after which Stone and Diller '
            'sold their WebSky shares. Combined with proceeds from other stock '

            'supplier of body armor to the United States military and law '

            "Chief Financial Officer, and Hatfield, DHB's former Chief "
            'Operating Officer, routinely overstated the value of the '
            "company's inventory and directed the booking of numerous "
            "fraudulent journal entries in order to reduce the company's cost "
            'of goods sold. This had the effect of falsely increasing the '
            "company's gross profit margins, and in some instances, net "
            'income. As a result of their misconduct, DHB materially misstated '

            "According to the SEC's complaint, Schlegel, of Eastport, N.Y., "

            'quantities, labor costs, overhead costs, and the amount of raw '
            "materials used in DHB's products. The complaint alleges that "
            'together Hatfield and Schlegel also transferred millions of '
            'dollars of expenses from cost of goods sold to research and '
            "development costs to materially increase the company's gross "
            'profit. The complaint further alleges that Schlegel falsely '
            "inflated DHB's $60 million charge against earnings taken in the "
            "third quarter of 2005 to mask her and Hatfield's fraudulent "
            "conduct. Schlegel is alleged to have lied to DHB's auditors and "
            'provided fake inventory schedules and other documents to conceal '

            'by over $8.2 million from the cashless exercise of warrants and '
            'sale of over 400,000 DHB shares. Schlegel and Hatfield sold these '

            'securities laws. Scientific-Atlanta entered into a marketing '
            'support agreement with Adelphia in 2000 that Adelphia misused to '
            'inflate its earnings by approximately $43 million. '
            'Scientific-Atlanta has agreed to pay $20 million in disgorgement '

            'federal court in Manhattan, alleges that in or about August 2000, '
            'Adelphia requested that Scientific-Atlanta increase the price of '
            'digital cable television set-top boxes it was selling to Adelphia '
            'and pay the amount of the price increase back to Adelphia in the '
            'form of marketing support for the stated purpose of marketing the '
            'Scientific-Atlanta cable television set-top boxes. Adelphia did '
            'not use the marketing support payments to market '
            'Scientific-Atlanta cable television set-top boxes. Adelphia '
            'recorded the price increase it paid Scientific-Atlanta as a '
            'capital expense, and recognized the marketing support payments as '
            'a contra marketing expense, thereby artificially reducing its '
            'marketing expense and increasing EBITDA. The transaction did not '
            "impact Scientific-Atlanta's public financial statements. \n"
            'The Complaint alleges that Scientific-Atlanta was aware of a '
            'number of facts that together demonstrated that Adelphia was '
            'misusing the marketing support agreement. Those facts included, '
            'among others, (i) a retroactive price increase on set-top boxes '
            "previously delivered to Adelphia; (ii) Adelphia's request for a "
            'commercially unreasonable high dollar amount in marketing support '
            'payments; (iii) repeated requests for higher levels of marketing '
            'support in later periods even though the major marketing push was '
            'to have occurred in earlier periods; (iv) knowledge that '
            "Adelphia's request for the marketing support agreement was driven "
            'by its desire to obtain an accounting benefit; and (v) the '
            'inclusion of a false reason for the price increase in one of the '
            'contracts documenting the marketing support agreement. \n'
            'Scientific-Atlanta, without admitting or denying the allegations '
            'in the Complaint, has consented to the entry of a final judgment, '

            'Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. The settlement takes '
            "into consideration Scientific-Atlanta's cooperation during the "
            'investigation. \n'

{'content': 'The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a complaint in '
            'the United States District Court for the Central District of '
            'California charging Ramy El-Batrawi, Adnan Khashoggi, and others '
            'with orchestrating a scheme to manipulate the stock price of '
            'GenesisIntermedia, Inc. (GENI), a now-defunct public company that '
            'was based in Van Nuys, California. The Commission alleges that '
            'the scheme, which occurred between September 1999 and September '
            '2001, resulted in the misappropriation of more than $130 million, '
            'the collapse of several broker-dealers, and the largest bailout '
            'in the history of the Securities Investor Protection '
            'Corporation.\n'
            "According to the complaint, Ramy El-Batrawi, GENI's Chief "
            'Executive Officer at the time, and Adnan Khashoggi, with the '
            'assistance of Richard J. Evangelista, Wayne Breedon, and Kenneth '
            "P. D'Angelo (a stock loan broker previously charged by the SEC "
            'and criminal authorities), developed a manipulation scheme by '
            'which they could profit from lending GENI shares (rather than '
            'selling them). The complaint alleges that El-Batrawi and '
            'Khashoggi, through an offshore entity called Ultimate Holdings, '
            'loaned approximately 15 million shares of GENI stock to '
            "Evangelista's employer at the time, Native Nations Securities, a "
            'New Jersey broker-dealer, and more than a dozen other '
            'broker-dealers in exchange for cash based upon the market value '
            'of the shares.\n'
            'According to the complaint, Ultimate Holdings loaned stock '
            "through Native Nations (and other broker-dealers) to Breedon's "
            'employer at the time, Deutsche Bank Securities Limited in Canada, '
            'and received the current market value of the stock in cash. As '
            "GENI's stock price fluctuated, the loaned stock was "
            'marked-to-market by the broker-dealers. Ultimate Holdings '
            "received additional cash when GENI's price increased, and was "
            'obligated to return cash when the stock price dropped. By lending '
            'the shares in this manner, El-Batrawi and Khashoggi raised '
            'approximately $130 million without giving up control of the stock '
            'or depressing the market price for the stock.\n'
            "The complaint also alleges that the defendants inflated GENI's "
            'stock price by systematically engaging in fraudulent and '
            'deceptive practices that had the intended effect of generating '
            'additional cash proceeds from the broker-dealers participating in '
            'the stock loan transactions. Their illegal manipulative '
            'activities included reducing the supply of GENI stock to control '
            'the public float, promoting a short squeeze without disclosing to '
            'GENI shareholders that El-Batrawi and Ultimate Holdings had '
            'effectively already sold their stock through the stock loans and '
            'were attempting to prevent their stock loans from unraveling, and '
            'making trades through nominee accounts. The complaint alleges '
            'that while these activities were ongoing, El-Batrawi also was '
            'secretly compensating Courtney Smith, a well-known financial '
            'commentator, to tout GENI on television to create demand for the '
            "stock, and, in conjunction with Douglas Jacobson, GENI's chief "
            'financial officer at the time, was making false and misleading '
            'statements in periodic reports filed with the Commission.\n'
            "The manipulation caused GENI's stock price to increase "
            'approximately 1,400%, from a low of $1.67 per share (split '
            'adjusted) on September 1, 1999 to a high of $25 per share on June '
            "29, 2001. After the scheme collapsed in September 2001, GENI's "
            'stock price plunged to pennies per share. El-Batrawi and Ultimate '
            'Holdings then defaulted on their obligations to repay the '
            'approximately $130 million they had obtained from the stock '
            'loans, which caused several of the broker-dealers in the stock '
            'loan chain to go bankrupt.\n'
            'The Commission charged El-Batrawi, Khashoggi, Ultimate Holdings, '
            'Evangelista, and Breedon with violating the antifraud provisions '
            'of the federal securities laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the '
            'Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange '
            'Act, in connection with the stock loan and manipulation scheme. '
            'The Commission also charged GENI, El-Batrawi, and Jacobson with '
            'violating these antifraud provisions by making false and '
            "misleading statements and material omissions in GENI's filings "
            'with the Commission; charged GENI with violating the reporting '
            'and books and records provisions of Sections 13(a) and '
            '13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and '
            '13a-13; and charged El-Batrawi and Jacobson with violating '
            'Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 '
            "and aiding and abetting GENI's violations of the reporting and "
            'books and records provisions. The Commission further charged '
            'Ultimate Holdings with making false or misleading statements in '
            'certain filings with the Commission, in violation of Section '
            '13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13d-1 and 13d-2. As relief, '
            'the Commission is seeking permanent injunctions against all '
            'defendants, an accounting of the money that defendants obtained '
            'as a result of their illegal conduct, disgorgement (with '
            'prejudgment interest), and civil penalties. The Commission is '
            'also seeking to bar El-Batrawi, Jacobson, and Khashoggi from '
            'serving as officers or directors of a public company.\n'
            'The Commission acknowledges the cooperation of the United States '
            "Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the "
            'Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.\n'
            'This is the third lawsuit that the Commission has filed in '

            'The Commission alleges in its complaint that in 1999, Cooper '
            'retained Caprio and another individual, now deceased, to sell '
            'stock for his company, Morgan Cooper, Inc. ("MCII").  According '

            'impending acquisition.  Before the acquisition was announced, '
            'Westbrook also purchased Eagle Bancshares stock.  Shortly after '

            '1993 through September 1996, Badger (the undisclosed control '
            'person of GVI and a recidivist violator of the federal securities '
            'laws) routinely engaged in fraudulent schemes to create the false '
            'appearance of market demand for GVI stock by paying undisclosed '
            'bribes to brokerage firms and individual brokers to induce them '

{'content': 'The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed an enforcement '
            'action against UBS AG, charging the firm with acting as an '
            'unregistered broker-dealer and investment adviser.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the "
            "District of Columbia, alleges that UBS's conduct facilitated the "
            'ability of certain U.S. clients to maintain undisclosed accounts '
            'in Switzerland and other foreign countries, which enabled those '
            'clients to avoid paying taxes related to the assets in those '
            "accounts. UBS agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to "
            'the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins UBS and '
            'orders it to disgorge $200 million.\n'
            "As alleged in the SEC's complaint, from at least 1999 through "
            '2008, UBS acted as an unregistered broker-dealer and investment '
            'adviser to thousands of U.S. persons and offshore entities with '
            'United States citizens as beneficial owners.  UBS had at least '
            '11,000 to 14,000 of such clients and held billions of dollars of '
            'assets for them.  The U.S. cross-border business provided UBS '
            'with revenues of $120 to $140 million per year.\n'
            'The SEC also alleges that UBS conducted that cross-border '
            'business largely through client advisers located primarily in '
            'Switzerland, who were not associated with a registered '
            'broker-dealer or investment adviser.  These client advisers '
            'traveled to the U.S., on average, two to three times per year on '
            'trips that generally varied in duration from one to three weeks.  '
            'In many instances, the client advisers attended exclusive events '
            'such as art shows, yachting events, and sporting events that were '
            'often sponsored by UBS, for the purpose of soliciting and '
            'communicating with United States cross-border clients.  UBS also '
            'used other U.S. jurisdictional means such as telephones, '
            'facsimiles, mail and e-mail to provide securities services to its '
            'U.S. cross-border clients.\n'
            'The SEC further alleges that UBS was aware that it was required '
            'to be registered with the SEC.  UBS took action to conceal its '
            'use of U.S. jurisdictional means to provide securities services.  '
            'Among other things, client advisers typically traveled to the '
            'U.S. with encrypted laptop computers that they used to provide '
            'account-related information, to show marketing materials for '
            'securities products, and occasionally to communicate orders for '
            'securities transactions to UBS in Switzerland.  Client advisers '
            'also received training on how to avoid detection by U.S. '
            'authorities of their activities in the U.S.\n'
            "As charged in the SEC's complaint, as a result of its conduct, "
            'UBS violated Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 '
            'and Section 203(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  To '
            'settle these charges, UBS has consented to the entry of a final '
            'judgment that (1) permanently enjoins UBS from further violation '
            'of those provisions; (2) orders it to pay $200 million in '
            'disgorgement, to be paid together with an additional $180 million '
            'in disgorgement that will be paid as part of a settlement of a '
            'related criminal investigation; and (3) orders UBS to comply with '
            'its undertakings to terminate its U.S. cross-border business and '
            'to retain an independent consultant to conduct an examination of '
            "UBS's termination of the business.\n"
            'In connection with a related criminal investigation, UBS has '

            'International, Inc., and William D. Shovers, former CFO of Hayes, '
            'after a jury found that they had violated the securities laws in '
            'connection with an accounting scheme at the company. The '
            'judgments were entered on December 18 and 22, 2008, following a '
            'remedy hearing before the Honorable Arthur J. Tarnow, United '
            'States District Judge.\n'
            'On December 22, 2008, Judge Tarnow entered final judgment against '
            'Shovers that imposed a civil monetary penalty of $50,000, '
            'enjoined him from violating the applicable antifraud and other '
            'provisions of the federal securities laws, and barred him from '
            'acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for '
            'a period of five years. On December 18, 2008, Judge Tarnow '
            'entered final judgment against Cucuz that imposed a $10,000 civil '
            'penalty and enjoined him from future violations of the applicable '
            'antifraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933.\n'
            'Previously, on August 20, 2008, a jury found that Shovers '
            'violated: (i) the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act '
            '(Section 17(a)(3)) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 '
            '(Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder); (ii) the internal '
            'controls and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act '
            '(Section 13(b)(5) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1); and (iii) the '
            'lying-to-auditor provision of the Exchange Act (Rule 13b2-2). The '
            'jury also found that Shovers aided and abetted violations of the '
            'issuer reporting, books and records, and internal control '
            'provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and '
            '13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13). '
            'Finally, the jury found Cucuz liable for violations of the '
            'antifraud provisions of the Securities Act (Section 17(a)(3)). '
            'The jury found Cucuz not liable on other charges.\n'
            'Cucuz and Shovers were the last two remaining defendants in this '
            'action. On January 14, 2007, the Court entered final judgment by '
            'consent against defendant Jesus Bonilla-Valdez (former Vice '
            "President of Hayes' Aluminum Wheel Group) that imposed a $30,000 "

            'District of Michigan filed criminal charges against Anthony A. '
            'James, a South Florida investment adviser.  The indictment '
            'charges James with two counts of mail fraud in connection with a '
            'multi-million dollar misappropriation and Ponzi scheme.  '
            'According to the indictment, between April 2001 and January 2008, '
            'James used his position as owner of James Asset Advisory, LLC '
            '("James Asset") to receive over $5.3 million from over 40 '
            'clients.  Those funds were supposed to be invested in various '
            'securities, bonds, and funds.  Instead of investing those funds, '
            'James used approximately $2.4 million of investor money for his '
            'own personal use and approximately $2.8 million of investor money '
            'to pay back other prior investors.\n'
            'In September 2008, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action '
            'in the United States District Court for the Southern District of '
            'Florida against James and James Asset, for misappropriating '
            "client funds and operating a Ponzi scheme.  The Commission's "
            'complaint alleged that the Defendants received at least $5.2 '
            'million from 44 clients who were told by the Defendants that '
            'client monies would be invested in stocks, bonds, and mutual '
            'funds.  According to the complaint, the Defendants never invested '
            'any client funds in the stock market or other investments.  '
            'Instead, James misappropriated at least $2.4 million in client '
            'monies to fund his lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of a '
            'six-bedroom, 5,000 square foot home, a luxury condominium, a '
            'Porsche sports car, and season tickets to the Miami Heat games.  '
            'Moreover, like a classic Ponzi scheme, the Defendants transferred '
            'approximately $2.8 million from new clients to existing clients '
            'to repay principal or to create the illusion of profitable '
            'trading.  In addition, to facilitate and otherwise conceal their '
            'fraud, the complaint alleged that the Defendants provided clients '
            'with false account statements reflecting securities holdings and '
            'returns that did not exist.  On September 25, 2008, the Court '

            "Massachusetts. The Commission's action, filed on February 20, "
            '2007, alleged that Braintree and Graham fraudulently offered and '

            'and/or fractional interests in oil and gas leases and that Graham '
            'diverted almost $3 million for his own personal use. The final '

            "According to the Commission's complaint, from at least 2000 "

            'misrepresentations to more than 200 investors nationwide and in '

            'they could expect the return of their principal within months to '
            'a year and that Graham failed to disclose that he intended to and '

            'Recidivist Initiative which has thus far resulted in enforcement '
            'actions against 23 individuals, nine of whom also have been '
            'charged by criminal authorities.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the "
            'Southern District of Florida, charges Joseph A. Rubbo and Angela '
            'Beckcom Rubbo Monaco, both of Coral Springs, Florida, with '
            'defrauding investors through offerings by their companies VIP TV '
            'LLC, VIP Television Inc., and The Spongebuddy LLC. \xa0Rubbo and '
            'Monaco are repeat offenders whose prior securities schemes '
            'resulted in criminal convictions against Rubbo and SEC '
            'injunctions against both Rubbo and Monaco.\n'
            "According to the SEC's complaint, Rubbo and Monaco raised at "
            'least $5.4 million from 11 primarily elderly investors to fund '
            'the growth of their entertainment business and develop the '
            'Spongebuddy, a sponge-like glove purportedly to be sold in '
            'stores.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint alleges that Rubbo and Monaco controlled the "
            'companies and hired Steven Dykes to cold call investors and pitch '
            'investments in VIP.\xa0 For example, Dykes allegedly told an '
            'investor that the Starz cable channel and Pandora Radio were both '
            'interested in buying VIP and would roll-up VIP into these '
            'entities. \xa0The investor also was allegedly told that the '
            'Spongebuddy would be featured on the television show Shark Tank '
            'and marketed on QVC.\xa0 Contrary to alleged representations that '
            'investor money would be used to benefit the VIP companies, Rubbo '
            'and Monaco misappropriated more than $2.6 million in investor '
            'funds to pay themselves and their relatives as well as '
            'undisclosed sales commissions to Dykes.\xa0 The complaint also '
            'alleges they paid for personal expenses such as the down payment '
            'on a luxury vehicle, credit card bills, unrelated construction '
            'work and to finance a business operation for a Monaco family '
            'member.\n'
            'During the time of the alleged scheme, neither Rubbo, Monaco, nor '
            'Dykes were registered with the Commission.\xa0 The SEC encourages '
            'all investors to check the background of people selling '
            'investments by using the search tool on Investor.gov to quickly '
            'identify whether the sellers are registered professionals.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint charges Rubbo and Monaco with violating the "
            'antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of '
            '1933 (Securities Act) (as to Rubbo, Section 17(a)(1) and (3) '
            'only), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 '
            '(Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (as to Rubbo, Rule '

            'violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Section '
            '15(a) of the Exchange Act and charged Rubbo and Monaco aiding and '
            "abetting Dykes' violations.  The SEC is seeking the return of the "

            "Peterson fraudulently misappropriated $350,000 of their client's "
            'money, using $100,000 of those funds to make investments in their '

            "a client's assets as collateral to secure loan financing for a "

            'the Partial Final Judgment issued by the District Court on August '

            'Massachusetts entered final judgment against relief defendant '
            'Shawnet Thibeault in an SEC enforcement action.  The complaint, '
            'which the Commission filed in January 2015, charged investment '
            'adviser Daniel Thibeault and others with fraud for '
            'misappropriating money from an investment fund.  The complaint '
            "named Mr. Thibeault's wife, Shawnet Thibeault, as a relief "
            'defendant.  According to the complaint, she received some of the '
            'money that had been misappropriated from investors.  The judgment '
            'entered against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to disgorge over '
            '$500,000.\n'
            'According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault misappropriated money '
            'from an investment fund that he was managing.  Specifically, the '
            'SEC alleged that Mr. Thibeault and his companies were the '
            'investment advisers to the GL Beyond Income Fund, and that they '
            "misappropriated at least $15 million of the Fund's money.  "
            'According to the complaint, Mr. Thibeault represented that '
            "investors' money would be pooled and used to make or purchase "
            'consumer loans.  These consumer loans would then constitute the '
            "Fund's assets, and would provide a return to the investors when "
            'interest and principal payments were made on the loans.  The '
            'complaint alleged that Mr. Thibeault and the other defendants '
            '(not including Shawnet Thibeault) engaged in a scheme to create '
            'fictitious loans to steal money from the Fund, and to report '
            'those fake loans as assets of the Fund.  Mr. Thibeault and the '
            'other defendants designed this scheme to conceal their '
            'misappropriation of millions of dollars from the Fund.\n'
            'The final judgment against Shawnet Thibeault orders her to pay '
            'disgorgement of $468,236, representing money she received as a '

{'content': 'On January 10, 2018 and February 16, 2018, the U.S. District '
            'Court for the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments '
            'against Jamie Meadows and Eric McPhail, respectively, defendants '
            'in an SEC enforcement action filed in July 2014 alleging that '
            'McPhail, Meadows and others committed insider trading in the '
            'stock of Massachusetts-based American Superconductor Corp.  The '
            'SEC has now obtained final judgments against all of the '
            'defendants in this case, and has obtained orders for full '
            'disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains against the traders.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint, filed on July 11, 2014, alleged that McPhail "
            'repeatedly provided non-public information about American '
            'Superconductor to six of his friends, including Meadows.  '
            "McPhail's source of inside information was an American "
            'Superconductor executive who belonged to the same country club as '
            'McPhail and was a close friend.  According to the complaint, from '
            'July 2009 through April 2011, the executive told McPhail about '
            "American Superconductor's expected earnings, contracts, and other "
            'major pending corporate developments, trusting that McPhail would '
            'keep the information confidential, while McPhail instead '
            'misappropriated the inside information and tipped his friends, '
            'including Meadows, who improperly traded on the information.  The '
            "SEC's complaint alleged that the six traders profited by a total "
            'of over $554,000 through their illegal insider trading.\n'
            'The judgment against McPhail, to which he consented, enjoined him '
            'from committing future violations of the antifraud provisions of '
            'federal securities laws.  In June 2015, McPhail was convicted '
            'after a jury trial in a related criminal insider trading action '
            'brought by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, '
            'and in September 2015 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and '
            'two years of supervised release.  The judgement against Meadows '
            'enjoined him from violating the antifraud provisions of the '
            'federal securities laws, ordered him to pay full disgorgement of '
            '$191,521 plus prejudgment interest of $41,841, and ordered him to '
            'pay a civil penalty of $191,521.  Meadows had consented to a '
            'judgment with the injunction and disgorgement and interest '
            'amounts, and the court determined the amount of the penalty after '
            'a hearing.\n'

            'securities to about 400 investors nationwide between August 1997 '
            'and June 1999.  Womack represented to investors that he would '

            'Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the '

            'controls, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal '
            'securities laws.  InaCom, a Delaware corporation headquartered in '
            'Omaha, Nebraska, was primarily a value-added computer reseller '
            'that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 16, '

            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'According to the Complaint, Guenthner and Samuelson engaged in a '

            'Commission on or about May 11, 1999, August 10, 1999, and '
            'November 9, 1999.  During the first three quarters of 1999, the '
            'Commission claims that Guenthner and Samuelson improperly accrued '
            'unallocated, general reserves, then reversed $7.1 million of '
            'these reserves into income in the third quarter of 1999.  The '
            'Complaint states these unjustified reversal of reserves in the '
            'third quarter of 1999 lacked any credible basis.  Also, according '
            'to the Complaint, in the third quarter of 1999, Guenthner and '
            'Samuelson knowingly posted $10.8 million of inventory cost '
            'reductions that related to prior quarters, thereby further '
            'artificially inflating income in the third quarter of 1999.  The '
            'Commission alleges that because of these inappropriate accounting '
            'practices in the third quarter of 1999, the company reported a '
            'profit when in reality the company had suffered a loss.  In '
            'addition, the Complaint states that throughout the first three '
            'quarters of 1999, that Guenthner caused InaCom to recognize '
            'manufacturer rebates to which it was not entitled, thereby '
            'understating its cost of goods sold and overstating net income.  '
            'According to the Complaint, this inclusion of improper '

            'supposedly secured by surety bonds issued by United States '
            'Guarantee Corporation, an Arizona based surety company.  In '
            'reality, the control persons behind Chemical Trust were diverting '
            'investor funds to their own use and the surety company was being '
            'run by a convicted felon and held no assets with which to secure '
            'the promissory notes.  The Commission alleged that the defendants '
            "were in a position to learn of the issuer's fraudulent scheme, "
            'but failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence before selling '
            'the securities to their insurance clients.  The Commission '
            'further alleged that the defendants made fraudulent statements in '
            'connection with the sale of the Chemical Trust promissory notes '

            'defendants raised approximately $457,300 from approximately '
            'fifteen investors and misappropriated a large percentage of those '

            'Jean Pierre, age 29, was last known to be a resident of '

            '$304,700 through the sale of unregistered limited partnership '
            'interests in JB Stanley, an unregistered hedge fund.  Jean Pierre '
            'and Lee told investors, orally and in writing, that JB Stanley '
            'was a hedge fund that pooled investor funds to purchase and sell '
            'securities.  In fact, only a small portion of the offering '

            "JB Stanley's business history and prospects, and Jean Pierre's "
            'history as a fund manager.  To induce investors to maintain their '
            'investment at JB Stanley, Jean Pierre and Lee sent investors '

            'business, the existence of a proposed merger, and the value of '
            'Cambridge stock.  To induce investors to purchase UTC stock, the '

            'Hoffman, Klinger, and Paonessa controlled and caused the '
            'corporate defendants to make at least 21 fraudulent mini-tender '
            'offers for the securities of five publicly traded limited '
            'partnerships since 1997.  The complaint alleges that defendants '
            'made the mini-tender offers by means of separate, but '
            'substantially similar three-page offering circulars.  The '
            'complaint further alleges that the defendants deliberately '
            'designed the circulars to conceal from investors the true '
            'offering price by stating a certain offering price in large, bold '
            'print on the first page and burying deductions in very small, '
            'closely spaced print on the second page.  According to the '
            'complaint, the defendants paid investors who tendered their '
            'limited partnership units pursuant to such mini-tender offers '
            'only a small fraction of the offering price stated on the first '
            'page of the circular because of deductions buried on the second '
            'page of the circular.  As a result of the fraudulent mini-tender '
            'offers, the defendants obtained more than 80,000 units of five '
            'limited partnerships from more than 4,000 investors.  Based on '
            'the prices the defendants actually paid for the units and the '
            'market prices of the units, the defendants appear to have '

            "The Commission's Complaint alleges that from March 1998 through "
            'June 1999, the Defendants engaged in a pump and dump scheme '
            'involving the stock of Maid Aide, Inc. ("MDAN"), a shell company '
            'trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board ("OTC-BB").  The '
            'complaint alleges that as a result of this scheme, MDAN traded at '
            'artificially inflated prices ranging between $5.00 and $9.35 per '
            'share, allowing the Defendants to dump more than 475,000 MDAN '
            'shares into the market for proceeds of over $3.7 million.  In '
            'addition, the complaint alleges the following:\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            ' Although MDAN purported to be a commercial and residential '
            'cleaning services company, it was actually nothing more than a '
            'publicly trading shell corporation controlled by Tanner and '
            "Evans.  Tanner and Evans controlled at least 90% of MDAN's public "
            'float. In early 1998, Tanner entered into an agreement with '
            'Taylor, Kurtz, and Ruggiero that entitled Taylor, Kurtz, and '
            'Ruggiero to 125,000 MDAN shares each.  Tanner, Taylor, Kurtz, and '
            'Ruggiero agreed to set up boiler rooms that would sell these '
            'shares to the public in exchange for undisclosed kickbacks paid '
            'from the sale proceeds.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            ' On February 27, 1998, Tanner, Taylor, Kurtz, and Ruggiero issued '
            'a press release announcing that MDAN intended to merge with CFE '
            'Trucking Inc., a private company that was in the business of '
            'hauling gravel for use in building and road construction.  '
            'Shortly after the press release was issued, two boiler rooms '
            'operating as BBS branch offices began cold calling investors to '
            'tout MDAN.  Boston supervised one of the BBS boiler rooms, and '
            'Sheyfer and Zalmenenko supervised the other.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            ' The cold callers working in the boiler rooms made numerous '
            'material misrepresentations to investors, including baseless '
            "predictions that MDAN's stock price would double in six months.  "
            'The cold callers also routinely posed as Boston and Ruggiero in '
            'order to hide their identities and the fact that they were not '
            'licensed brokers.  The cold callers failed to inform investors '
            'that they were being paid up to 70% of the proceeds from each '
            'MDAN stock sale that they solicited.  Boston, Ruggiero, Sheyfer, '
            'and Zalmenenko were paid a portion of these kickbacks in exchange '
            'for supervising the boiler rooms.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            ' To further the scheme, Kurtz and Ruggiero recruited Kirkpatrick, '
            'a trader at Olsen Payne &amp; Co.  Kurtz and Ruggiero guaranteed '
            'that Kirkpatrick would be allowed to profit on all of his MDAN '
            "trades if his firm made a market in MDAN's securities.  "
            'Kirkpatrick agreed, and Olsen Payne &amp; Co. acted as market '
            'maker for MDAN from March 1998 through June 1999.  During this '
            'period, Kirkpatrick posted artificial price quotations concerning '
            "MDAN's stock on the OTC-BB and executed matched orders with other "
            'participants in the scheme in order to create artificial rises in '
            "MDAN's stock price and trading volume.\n"
            '\n'
            "The Commission's complaint charges all of the defendants with "
            'violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities '
            'laws, specifically Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 '
            '("Securities Act"), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act '
            'of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In '
            'addition, the complaint charges Tanner, Evans, Taylor, Ruggiero, '
            'and Boston with violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the '
            'Securities Act and Sheyfer and Zalmenenko with violations of '
            'Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of '
            'the Exchange Act.  The Commission seeks injunctions prohibiting '
            'future violations of the securities laws, disgorgement, and civil '
            'penalties.  The Commission is also seeking an order barring '
            'Tanner and Evans from serving as an officer or director of any '
            'public company.\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            "In addition to the Commission's civil action against Tanner, "
            'Evans, Ruggiero, Taylor, and Kurtz, these individuals were '
            'indicted on September 19, 2000 for their role in the MDAN scheme '
            'by the Department of Justice, Tax Division ("DOJ").  Tanner and '
            'Evans were found guilty in the criminal action on November 19, '
            '2001.  Ruggiero, Taylor, and Kurtz had previously entered guilty '

            'District of New York, alleging that Felix Litvinsky and Olga S. '
            'Litvinsky, a former employee of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. '
            '("J.P. Morgan"), engaged in illegal insider trading in advance of '
            'the July 30, 1998 announcement that BetzDearborn Inc. and '

            'information regarding the merger and tipped her then-boyfriend '
            'and roommate, and now husband, Felix Litvinsky.  According to the '

            'The complaint alleges that from April 1998 through the July 30, '

            "merger negotiations in secret.  Olga Litvinsky's supervisor, a "

            'with fraud for inflating the value of coal assets acquired for '
            '$3.7 billion and sold a few years later for $50 million.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in "
            'Manhattan, alleges that Rio Tinto, its former CEO Thomas '
            'Albanese, and its former CFO Guy Elliott failed to follow '
            'accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and '
            'record its assets.\xa0 Instead, as the project began to suffer '
            'one setback after another resulting in the rapid decline of the '
            'value of the coal assets, they sought to hide or delay disclosure '
            'of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio '
            "Tinto's Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent "
            'auditors, and investors.\n'
            "Based on the complaint's allegations, Rio Tinto plc, Rio Tinto "
            'Limited, Albanese, and Elliott are charged with violating the '
            'antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal controls '
            'provisions of the federal securities laws.\xa0 The SEC seeks '
            'permanent injunctions, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus '
            'interest, and civil penalties from all the defendants, and seeks '
            'to bar Albanese and Elliott from serving as public company '
            'officers or directors.\n'
            "According to the SEC's complaint, in 2011, Rio Tinto acquired "
            'coal assets in Mozambique shortly after disclosing huge losses '
            'associated with its previous large-scale acquisition of '
            "Alcan.\xa0 Both acquisitions took place under Albanese's "
            'leadership.\xa0 The second acquisition was also unsuccessful as '
            'it was based on the incorrect assumption that Rio Tinto could '
            'inexpensively mine, transport, and sell large quantities of '
            'high-quality coal, chiefly using barges for shipping.\xa0 The '
            "SEC's complaint alleges that the project suffered setbacks almost "
            'immediately, as Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott learned that '
            'there was less coal and of lower quality than expected, and that '
            'Mozambique had rejected its barge application. The complaint '
            'alleges that the drop in quantity and quality of coal, coupled '
            'with the lack of infrastructure to transport it, significantly '
            'eroded the value of the acquisition.\n'
            'The complaint alleges that after already impairing Alcan twice, '
            'Rio Tinto, Albanese, and Elliott knew that publicly disclosing '
            'its second failure and rapidly declining value would call into '
            "question their ability to pursue the core of Rio Tinto's business "
            'model to identify and develop long-term, low-cost, and '
            'highly-profitable mining assets.\xa0 Instead, they concealed the '
            'adverse developments, allowing Rio Tinto to release misleading '
            'financial statements days before a series of U.S. debt '
            'offerings.\xa0 Rio Tinto raised $5.5 billion from U.S. investors, '
            'approximately $3 billion of which was raised after May 2012, when '
            'executives at Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique had already told Albanese '
            'and Elliott that the subsidiary was likely worth negative $680 '
            'million.\xa0 The complaint alleges Albanese then repeated and '
            'reinforced the false positive outlook for the project in public '
            'statements.\n'
            'The alleged fraud continued until January 2013, when an executive '
            "in Rio Tinto's Technology &amp; Innovation Group discovered that "
            'the coal assets were being carried at an inflated value on Rio '
            "Tinto's financial statements.\xa0 After an internal review "
            "allegedly triggered by the executive's report to Rio Tinto's "
            'Chairman, Rio Tinto announced that Albanese had resigned and the '
            'company reduced the value of the coal assets by more than $3 '
            'billion, or more than 80 percent.\xa0 After a second reduction, '
            'Rio Tinto sold the Mozambique subsidiary for $50 million, '

            '206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The '

            'The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled '
            'civil action in federal court, in which BellSouth Corporation '
            '(BellSouth) consents to a judgment directing it to pay a $150,000 '
            "civil penalty.  The Commission's Complaint (Complaint) alleges "
            'that BellSouth violated certain provisions of the Foreign Corrupt '
            'Practices Act (FCPA).  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that '
            'BellSouth violated the books and records provisions - Section '
            '13(b)(2)(A) - and internal  controls provisions - Section '
            '13(b)(2)(B) - of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in '
            "connection with payments made by BellSouth's Venezuelan and "
            'Nicaraguan subsidiaries.  BellSouth settled the civil action '
            "without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations.  \n"

            '\n'
            '  According to the  Complaint, between September 1997 and August '
            "2000, former senior management of BellSouth's Venezuelan "
            'subsidiary, Telcel, C.A. (Telcel), authorized payments totaling '
            'approximately $10.8 million to six offshore companies and '
            "improperly recorded the disbursements in Telcel's books and "
            'records, based on fictitious invoices, as bona fide services.  '
            "Telcel's internal controls failed to detect the unsubstantiated "
            'payments for a period of at least two years.  As an additional '
            'consequence of this control deficiency, the Complaint alleges '
            'that BellSouth was unable to reconstruct the circumstances or '
            'purpose of the Telcel payments, or determine the identity of '
            "their ultimate recipients.   Telcel is Venezuela's leading "
            "wireless provider, contributing more revenue to BellSouth's Latin "
            'American Group segment than any other Latin American BellSouth '
            'operation.\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'The Complaint also alleges that, between October 1998 and June '
            "1999, BellSouth's  Nicaraguan subsidiary, Telefonia Celular de "
            "Nicaragua, S.A.'s (Telefonia), improperly recorded payments to "
            'the wife of the Nicaraguan legislator who was the chairman of the '
            'Nicaraguan legislative committee with oversight of Nicaraguan '
            'telecommunications.  \n'

            '\n'
            '\n'
            'According to the Complaint, in 1997 BellSouth acquired a 49 '
            'percent ownership interest in Telefonia, and an option to acquire '
            "an additional 40 percent.   At the time of BellSouth's "
            'acquisition of its minority interest in Telefonia, a Nicaraguan '
            'law prohibited foreign companies such as BellSouth from acquiring '
            'a majority interest in Nicaraguan telecommunications companies '
            '("foreign ownership restriction").   BellSouth intended to '
            'exercise its 40 percent option, but could do so only in the event '
            'that the Nicaraguan legislature repealed the foreign ownership '
            'restriction.   \n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            ' The Complaint alleges that, in October 1998, Telefonia retained '
            'the wife of the Nicaraguan legislator to provide various '
            'regulatory and legislative services, including lobbying for '
            'repeal of the foreign ownership restriction.   The wife '
            '(lobbyist) had prior financial and operations experience in the '
            'telecommunications area, but no prior legislative experience.  '
            "Because the lobbyist's husband chaired the legislative committee "
            'with jurisdiction over the foreign ownership restriction, '
            'BellSouth International (BSI), an indirectly wholly-owned '
            'subsidiary of BellSouth, knew that payments to the lobbyist could '
            'implicate the FCPA.  Nevertheless, a former BSI in-house attorney '
            "approved Telefonia's retention of the lobbyist.  BSI officials, "
            'however, knew or should have known that the attorney lacked '
            'sufficient experience or training to enable him properly to opine '
            'on the matter.\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'According to the Complaint, the lobbyist worked predominantly on '
            'the repeal of the foreign ownership restriction.  The Complaint '
            "further alleges that, during the lobbyist's retention, the "
            'legislator/husband drafted the text of the proposed repeal of the '
            'foreign ownership restriction and enlisted support for the '
            'proposed repeal from other Committee members.   The husband '
            'scheduled and presided at a hearing in April 1999, during which '
            'his Committee heard arguments from BSI and others advocating '
            'repeal of the foreign ownership restriction. \n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'In May 1999, Telefonia terminated the lobbyist.  In June 1999, '
            'Telefonia made a severance payment to her.  Telefonia recorded '
            'the total sum of $60,000 paid to the lobbyist as consulting '
            'services and as a severance payment.   In September 1999, the '
            'Committee referred the proposed amendment for approval by the '
            'Nicaraguan National Assembly.   In December 1999, the National '
            'Assembly voted to repeal the foreign ownership restriction.   '
            'BellSouth exercised its 40 percent option and increased its '
            'ownership interest in Telefonia to 89 percent in June 2000\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'In a related proceeding, the Commission today also issued a '
            'settled cease-and-desist order (Order) against BellSouth in which '
            'the Commission finds that BellSouth violated the books and '
            'records provisions and internal accounting controls provisions of '
            'the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with payments '

            'Southern District of California against three individuals and '
            'four related entities arising from their alleged involvement in a '

            'The Complaint alleges that defendant James E. Franklin devised a '
            'fraudulent scheme that began in January 1997 and continued into '
            '1998 to use Red Hot Stocks ("Red Hot "), an Internet website, as '
            'a vehicle to tout stocks that he and others had acquired cheaply '
            'through private offerings and open market purchases so that they '
            "could sell their shares at a profit following Red Hot's buy "
            'recommendations.  The Complaint alleges that defendant Samuel '
            'Wolanyk operated the Red Hot website, interviewed certain of the '
            'issuers, and drafted and disseminated some or all of the on-line '
            'recommendations.  The Complaint also alleges that defendant '
            'Dieter Raabe participated in the fraudulent scheme by issuing '
            'trading instructions for stocks profiled on Red Hot that were '
            'held in a Canadian brokerage account of defendant Vector Keel '
            'Ltd.  The Complaint alleges that both Raabe and Franklin had a '
            'beneficial interest in the Vector Keel account and that illegal '
            'trading profits from that account were wired to various entities '
            'affiliated with Franklin or Raabe, and that a portion of these '
            'illegal trading profits were received by defendant Net Income, a '
            'nominee corporation that Franklin set up to operate the Red Hot '
            'website.  The Complaint alleges that Franklin also sold stock of '
            'a company profiled on Red Hot through brokerage accounts of '
            'defendants Initial Public Offering Consultants, Inc. ("IPO") and '
            'Avalon Trust.  Further, according to the Complaint, certain of '

            'contained unreasonable price predictions, they failed adequately '
            'to disclose that defendants owned stock in profiled companies or '
            'expected to be compensated for promoting companies profiled on '
            'Red Hot and because defendants were engaged in a pattern of '
            'acquiring stocks profiled on Red Hot with the intent to sell in '
            'coordination with the touts, while Red Hot recommended that '

            'Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court '
            'for the District of Columbia entered a Final Judgment As To '
            'Vincent D. Celentano ("Final Judgment") in the above-captioned '
            'civil action.  The Commission sued Vincent D. Celentano '
            '("Celentano"), a Hillsboro Beach, Florida resident, for his role '
            'in two separate but related frauds concerning the securities of '

            '\n'
            '\n'
            'Celentano consented, without admitting or denying the allegations '
            "of the Commission's complaints, to entry of a Final Judgment that "
            'i) permanently enjoins him from violating or aiding and abetting '
            'the violation of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities '
            'Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), 15(a)(1) '

            'ii) permanently bars him from serving as an officer or director '
            'of a public company, and iii) orders him to pay a $350,000 civil '
            'money penalty.  The Commission also dismissed Mary N. Celentano, '
            "Celentano's wife, as a relief defendant.\n"
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'On June 18 and August 12, 1998, the Commission filed its '
            'complaint and amended complaint ("Complaints"), respectively, '
            'against Celentano and others based on their participation in '
            'fraudulent "pump and dump" schemes involving the purchase and '
            'sale of HealthCare and Novatek securities, both of which claimed '
            'to own licenses to distribute medical diagnostic test kits '
            'designed to rapidly diagnose HIV, cholera and other diseases.  In '
            '1995, HealthCare, a shell company controlled by Celentano and '
            'another defendant, raised approximately $2.5 million from '
            'investors, primarily friends and family members.  HealthCare '
            'falsely claimed to have signed contracts worth millions of '
            'dollars with Russian governmental entities for the sale of the '
            'test kits.  The Complaints allege, among other things, that 1) '
            "Celentano's offers and sales of HealthCare securities were not "
            'registered with the Commission, as required by law; 2) Celentano '
            'and others defrauded investors by knowingly making false and '
            'misleading statements regarding the existence of the '
            'multi-million dollar contracts; and 3) Celentano was not licensed '
            'to sell securities, as required by law.  In fact, no such '
            'contracts ever existed and HealthCare never sold any product for '
            'commercial purposes.     \n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'In 1996, Celentano and others orchestrated a second fraudulent '
            'scheme whereby they obtained more than $10 million from investors '
            'in connection with sales of Novatek securities.  Novatek claimed '
            'to own a license to distribute test kits in South and Central '
            'America.  Through a series of press releases, Novatek stated that '
            'it had entered into contracts worth more than $400 million with '
            'several South American entities.  The purported contracts, '
            'however, never existed and Novatek never made any commercial '
            'shipments of any test kits.  In connection with the Novatek '
            'fraud, the Complaints allege, among other things, that 1) '
            'Celentano and others artificially inflated the value of Novatek '
            'securities through a series of sham transactions; 2) Celentano '
            'caused Novatek to file reports with the Commission containing '
            'false and misleading financial statements; and 3) Celentano '
            'knowingly made false and misleading statements to investors and '
            'prospective investors concerning the existence of purported '
            'contracts.  \n'

            'of Florida.  In United States v. Celentano, 01-6179-CR-WDF, '
            'Celentano pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 for making '
            'a false statement to the Commission and was sentenced by Judge '
            'Wilkie D. Ferguson to two years probation and assessed a $5,000 '
            'fine.  The indictment against Trainor charges him with twenty-one '
            'counts of wire fraud and money laundering in violation of 18 '

            'securities fraud pending in the United States District Court for '
            'the Southern District of New York.  In a hearing in December, '
            "Judge Kimba M. Wood also granted the Commission's request for the "
            'appointment of a receiver for the related entities, Friedlander '
            'International Limited, Friedlander Management Limited, '
            'Friedlander Limited Partnership, and Friedlander Capital '
            'Management Corporation.  Judge Wood appointed Andrew Irving of '
            'the New York City firm Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn '
            '&amp; Berman as the receiver for those entities.  Friedlander, a '
            'securities trader, is a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut.  The '
            "defendants have filed a notice of appeal of Judge Wood's "
            'decision.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'The Commission filed its complaint in May of this year, alleging '
            "fraud in connection with Friedlander's management of the assets "
            'of Friedlander International Limited, an overseas hedge fund.  '
            'The Commission contended that Friedlander inflated the Hedge '
            "Fund's net asset value by improperly and arbitrarily valuing "
            'certain unlisted securities of a company in which Friedlander and '
            "entities he controlled had heavily invested.  The Commission's "
            'complaint also alleged that, between at least August 2000 and '
            'December 2000, Friedlander engaged in purchases of a thinly '
            'traded common stock as part of a manipulative scheme to inflate '
            "the value of that stock and to inflate the Hedge Fund's net asset "
            'value. SEC Litigation Release No. 17021 (June 1, 2001)\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'In granting the preliminary injunction, Judge Wood determined '
            'that Friedlander had disregarded a court-ordered process for '
            'obtaining input from the investors and had attempted to withdraw '
            'money from a Hedge Fund account despite a prior commitment not to '
            'do so without obtaining a court order.  Judge Wood cited '
            "Friedlander's past conduct, the danger of wasting investor "
            "assets, and the need to determine the hedge fund's activities as "
            'the bases for ordering the preliminary injunction.  Judge Wood '
            'also found that a receiver should be in place because the costs '
            'of a receiver were outweighed by the likelihood of future harm to '
            'the investors.\n'

            "into which the client's income and assets are placed to generate "

            'Reives, and Tri-Star Investment Group, L.L.C. a/k/a Tri-Star '
            'Investment Group, as defendants, and Lazor, Ltd. as a relief '
            'defendant, alleging a multimillion-dollar, nationwide, prime bank '
            'type and other securities fraud.  The complaint charges that '
            'Lazorwitz, a Texas resident, and Reives, a North Carolina '
            "resident, promoted the fraudulent scheme as Tri-Star's general "
            'partners.  The complaint also charges that relief defendant '
            'Lazor, Ltd. received ill-gotten assets from the fraud without any '
            'legitimate claim to those assets.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            "The Commission's complaint alleges that Lazorwitz and Reives used "
            'Tri-Star to offer and sell unregistered securities in Tri-Star to '
            'over 900 investors in at least 35 states, and to raise over $15 '
            'million and that Tri-Star, through Lazorwitz and Reives, '
            'initially represented that Tri-Star would invest in bank '
            'debentures and later claimed that it might invest in other '
            'international trade opportunities.  The complaint also alleges '
            'that Lazorwitz and Reives promoted Tri-Star directly and through '
            'independent agents around the United States known as Facilitators '
            'and led investors to expect profits of 20% per month in so-called '
            '13-month trading programs, after an initial 90-day waiting '

            '\n'
            "According to the Commission's complaint, Tri-Star, Lazorwitz, and "

            'investors concerning, among other things, the use of investor '
            'funds, the expected returns, and investment risks.  For example, '
            'the complaint alleges that Tri-Star, through Lazorwitz and '
            'Reives, misrepresented that investor funds would be used for '
            'lucrative trade opportunities when, in fact, Tri-Star "invested" '
            'relatively little of the funds collected, and never earned '
            'significant profits. It also alleges that they falsely '
            "represented to investors that the investors' funds would be "
            'collateralized by an insured certificate of deposit, that they '
            'caused false account statements to be issued to the investors and '
            'that they failed to disclose to investors that Tri-Star used '
            'investor funds to pay alleged profits and commissions to '
            'investors and Facilitators.  The complaint further alleges that '
            'Lazorwitz and Reives misappropriated investor funds for their '
            'personal benefit. \n'

            'order and agreement of the parties, Yoder was required to produce '
            'documents by December 19, 2001 and appear for testimony on '
            'December 27, 2001.  Yoder failed, however, to appear for '

            'Financial Officer of a subsidiary unit of Atchison Casting '
            'Corporation ("Atchison"), with accounting fraud.  The '
            "Commission's Complaint, filed in the United States District Court "
            'for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleges that, while '
            "Lambach was employed with Atchison's Pennsylvania Foundry Group "
            '("PFG"), he stole more than $900,000 of corporate funds and made '
            "numerous false accounting entries in the PFG's books and records, "
            'which had the effect of concealing his theft and making the PFG '
            'and, in turn, Atchison, appear more profitable than they were.\n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Lambach made or caused '
            'to be made "miscellaneous adjustment" journal entries over a '
            "multi-year period to alter balances in various of the PFG's "
            'accounts.  These adjustments lacked any economic or accounting '
            'justification.  Mr. Lambach also allegedly created fictitious '
            'asset and other accounts that lacked any support or substance.  '
            'During the same period, Lambach stole more than $900,000 of '
            'corporate funds by writing numerous unauthorized checks payable '
            'to himself from certain Atchison bank accounts.  \n'
            '\n'
            '\n'
            'The Complaint further details that Lambach, in his position as '
            'CFO of the PFG, regularly compiled and transmitted the fraudulent '
            "accounting information for the PFG to Atchison's corporate "
            "offices for inclusion in the company's consolidated financial "
            "statements.  As a result of Lambach's conduct, the periodic "
            'reports filed by Atchison with the Commission for its fiscal '
            'years ending June 30, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, contained '
            'materially false and misleading consolidated financial '
            'statements.  More specifically, the Complaint alleges that, over '
            "that period, Atchison's net income was overstated by between 12% "
            'and 575% and its operating income was overstated by as much as '
            '1580%.  The Commission also alleges that Lambach actively '
            'attempted to conceal his accounting fraud and theft by '
            "interfering with an audit conducted by Atchison's independent "
            'auditors in July and August 2000.     \n'
            '\n'

            'Lambach resigned his position in October 2000, and, on November '
            '2, Atchison announced that it had discovered accounting errors '
            'involving the PFG and that it had begun an investigation into the '
            'matter.  On April 24, 2001, Atchison announced it had completed '
            'its investigation and restated its financial statements for the '
            'fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 30, 2000, including '
            'a reduction in net income of approximately $24.5 million over '

            'Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder.  Lambach has agreed to settle '

            'risk-free returns of 20-25% per week.  In material distributed to '

            'The Commission announced a settlement today in a nationwide ponzi '
            'scheme in which over $4.5 million was raised from 75 mostly '
            'elderly Texas investors.  Under the terms of the settlement, '
            'defendants Kurtis Keith Lowe, Woody Keith Lowe, Jerry Lynn Ruyle '
            'and Robert Alen Blackburn, agreed to a permanent injunction '
            'against future violations of the securities laws.  Previously, in '
            'a South Carolina criminal proceeding, all were ordered to '
            'disgorge commissions each received from their participation in '
            'the ponzi scheme.  In that proceeding, Kurtis Keith Lowe was '
            'ordered to disgorge $244,084 in unlawful commissions, Woody Keith '
            'Lowe $365,560, Ruyle $135,000 and Blackburn $69,259.  The '
            'Commission decided not to seek a civil penalty against each based '
            'upon his demonstrated financial inability to pay a penalty.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'In its civil action, the Commission alleged that defendants sold '
            'promissory notes issued by Chemical Trust, a purported business '
            'trust, as part of a nationwide ponzi scheme.  The promissory '
            'notes were claimed to be secured by surety bonds issued by United '
            'States Guarantee Corporation, an Arizona based surety company.  '
            'In reality, the control persons behind Chemical Trust were '
            'diverting investor funds to their own use and the surety company '
            'was being run by a convicted felon and held no assets with which '
            'to secure the promissory notes.  The Commission alleged that the '
            "defendants were in a position to learn of the issuer's fraudulent "
            'scheme, but failed to conduct any meaningful due diligence before '
            'selling the securities to their insurance clients.  The '
            'Commission further alleged the defendants made fraudulent '
            'statements in connection with the sale of the Chemical Trust '
            'promissory notes and acted as unregistered brokers.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'The defendants consented, without admitting or denying the '
            'allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a final judgment '
            'permanently enjoining each from future violations of Section '
            '17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) '
            'of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 '
            'thereunder.  The court entered the permanent injunction on '
            'January 2, 2002.  In addition, each defendant consented to the '
            'entry of an administrative order barring him from association '

            'The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, on '
            'January 14, 2002, it filed an action to enforce a "forthwith" '
            'subpoena against Dennis S. Herula, a former broker at the '
            'Cranston, Rhode Island branch of Raymond James Financial '
            'Services, Inc.  The Commission served the subpoena on Herula at '
            'the San Francisco Airport on January 9, 2002, requiring him to '
            'immediately turn over financial account records and other '
            'documents he was carrying into the U.S. from Bermuda. When served '
            'with the subpoena, however, Herula refused to comply, claiming he '
            'did not have any such documents in his possession. The Commission '
            'alleges in its papers that, contrary to his representations, '
            'Herula did have responsive financial account records with him '
            'when he was served with the subpoena.  Accordingly, the '
            'Commission filed its Application for an Order to Show Cause and '
            'For an Order Requiring Compliance with Administrative Subpoena '
            'Against Dennis S. Herula.  The action was filed in Rhode Island '
            'federal district court.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'In its Application and supporting papers, the Commission alleges '
            'that, on December 26, 2001, the Commission issued an Order '
            'Directing Private Investigation and Designating Officers to Take '
            'Testimony ("Formal Order") in the matter of Brite Business '
            'Corporation.  The Formal Order authorizes the staff to conduct an '
            'investigation into whether Brite Business or others violated the '
            'federal securities laws in connection with the solicitation of '
            'investments, and whether investor funds subsequently were '
            'misappropriated.  According to the Commission, Herula, who was '
            'terminated by Raymond James in January 2001, served as the broker '
            'for at least two Raymond James accounts that may have held '
            'millions of dollars in investor funds raised by Brite Business.  '
            "The Commission staff has been investigating Herula's activities "
            'to determine, among other things, what happened to Brite Business '
            'investor funds.  \n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'The Commission alleges that Herula was arrested in Bermuda in '
            'December 2001 after he purportedly submitted false documents to a '
            'Bermuda bank in connection with an attempt to transfer $10 '
            'million from banks in Europe and South America.  When Herula was '
            'arrested, the Bermuda police seized from him two laptop computers '
            'and numerous documents.  According to the Commission, the Bermuda '
            'police confirmed that the documents and laptops they seized '
            'contained financial account information that would have been '
            "responsive to the Commission's January 9 subpoena.  Herula "
            'subsequently pled guilty to the offense of "uttering a forged '
            'document" and was given a one month prison sentence in Bermuda.  '
            "According to the Commission, upon Herula's release from jail on "
            'January 9, 2002, the Bermuda Police returned to him the documents '
            'and laptops they had seized, and Herula subsequently boarded a '
            'flight to the United States carrying the materials with him.  The '
            'Commission alleges that, when Herula arrived at his final '
            'destination in San Francisco on the evening of January 9, he was '
            'carrying a black bag similar to the one that had contained the '
            'laptops earlier that day.   According to the Commission, the '
            'Bermuda police also confirmed that there was enough room in the '
            'black bag for Herula tohave fit the documents that were returned '
            'to him as well.  Despite this evidence, the Commission alleges '
            'that Herula claimed, first to the process server and subsequently '
            'to the Commission staff in a telephone call the next day, that he '
            'did not have any responsive materials in his possession when he '
            'was served with the subpoena. According to the Commission, Herula '
            'told the process server that the documents were in Boston, and '
            'then contradicted himself the next day when he told the '
            'Commission staff the documents were in Rhode Island.\n'
            '\n'
            '  \n'
            'Pursuant to its Application, the Commission is seeking an order '
            'directing Herula to show cause why the Court should not enter an '
            "order requiring Herula to comply with the Commission's subpoena "
            'for documents, and an order compelling Herula to immediately '

            'WASHINGTON - The Securities and Exchange Commission announced '
            'today that it settled charges against Credit Suisse First Boston '
            'Corporation ("CSFB"), a New York-based brokerage firm and '
            "investment bank, relating to the Commission's investigation of "
            "the firm's IPO allocation practices.  CSFB agreed (1) to pay a "
            "total of $100 million in the Commission's action and in a related "
            'action announced today by the National Association of Securities '
            'Dealers Regulation, Inc. ("NASDR"); (2) to be enjoined by a '
            'federal court from future violations; and (3) to adopt extensive '
            'new policies and procedures.  The $100 million payment is '
            'composed of $70 million in disgorgement of improper gains, and '
            '$30 million in civil penalties or fines.  \n'
            'In connection with this matter, the Commission today filed a '
            'Complaint against CSFB in the U.S. District Court for the '
            'District of Columbia, alleging violations of certain Conduct '
            'Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. '
            '("NASD"), and of books and records requirements under the federal '
            'securities laws.  Given the nature and scale of the misconduct '
            'alleged in the Complaint, the Commission determined to seek an '
            'injunction based, in part, on violations of NASD Conduct Rules.  '
            'According to the Complaint, in exchange for shares in "hot" IPOs, '
            'CSFB wrongfully extracted from certain customers a large portion '
            'of the profits that those customers made by immediately selling '
            '("flipping") their IPO stock.  The profits were channeled to CSFB '
            'in the form of excessive brokerage commissions generated by the '
            'customers in unrelated securities trades that the customers '
            'effected solely to share the IPO profits with CSFB.  \n'
            "The Commission's Complaint alleges as follows:\n"
            'From at least April 1999 through June 2000, CSFB employees '
            'allocated shares of IPOs to over 100 customers who were willing '
            'to funnel between 33 and 65 percent of their IPO profits to '
            'CSFB.  The profits were channeled to CSFB in the form of '
            'excessive brokerage commissions generated by the customers in '
            'unrelated securities trades that the customers effected solely to '
            "satisfy CSFB's demands for a share of the IPO profits.\n"
            'The profit-sharing activity was pervasive in certain customer '
            "accounts serviced by CSFB's Institutional Sales Trading Desk, "
            'Private Client Services ("PCS") Group and Technology PCS Group '
            '("Tech PCS").  Generally, these customers received no more than '
            '10 percent of the IPO stock that CSFB allocated as lead managing '
            'underwriter during the relevant time period.  Nonetheless, IPO '
            'trading was so profitable during this period that the relevant '
            'customers funneled tens of millions of dollars in profits to CSFB '
            'through improper commission payments.\n'
            "Employees of CSFB's Equity Capital Markets, PCS, and Tech PCS "
            'divisions informed the relevant customers, both implicitly and '
            'explicitly, that they were expected to pay a portion of profits '
            'earned on their IPO flipping to CSFB in order to continue to '
            'receive allocations in "hot" IPOs.  Customers who refused to '
            'funnel a portion of their profits to CSFB received smaller '
            'allocations, and in some instances were denied allocations '
            'altogether.  \n'
            'To maximize commission payments to CSFB, the relevant customers '
            'paid excessive commissions on off-setting trades in large '
            'capitalization, highly liquid, exchange-listed securities '
            'otherwise unrelated to the IPOs.  CSFB employees sometimes '
            'assisted certain of the customers in effecting these off-setting '
            'trades. The sole purpose of this trading activity was to generate '
            'commissions for CSFB.  Customers frequently executed one side of '
            'the trade with CSFB (e.g., a purchase at a commission as high as '
            '$3.15 per share) and then virtually simultaneously executed the '
            'off-setting side of the trade through another broker-dealer '
            '(e.g., a sale of the same quantity of the same stock) at the '
            'standard commission of $.06 per share.\n'
            'Each of the CSFB business units that participated in the IPO '
            'allocation process engaged in explicit and implicit policies and '
            'practices to obtain improper payments from certain customers in '
            'exchange for allocations in hot IPOs.  Participation in this '
            'conduct extended to senior levels of these business units and was '
            'widespread within the relevant business units.  Senior executives '
            'in managerial and supervisory roles knew of the practices '
            'described in the Complaint, encouraged many of the practices '
            'described in the Complaint, directed CSFB employees to urge '
            'customers to maintain specified ratios of commissions to IPO '
            'profits, and, in some instances, personally engaged in some of '
            'the practices described in the Complaint. \n'
            'The practices described in the Complaint were not isolated '
            'occurrences.  Rather, these practices were a fundamental part of '
            'the manner in which CSFB dealt with a small but significant '
            'portion of its customer base.  The prevalence of these practices '
            'is reflected in numerous e-mail messages and other '
            'communications, several of which are cited in the Complaint.  \n'
            "CSFB has agreed to settle the Commission's action and has "
            'consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the '
            'Complaint, to the entry of a final judgment that: (1) permanently '
            'enjoins CSFB, directly or indirectly, from certain violations of '
            'NASD Conduct Rules 2110 and 2330 and Section 17(a)(1) of the '
            'Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.  78q, and Rule 17a-3, 17 C.F.R  '
            '240.17a-3, thereunder; (2) orders disgorgement of $70 million, '
            "which would be reduced to $35 million in recognition of CSFB's "
            'anticipated payment of $35 million in disgorgement to NASDR in a '
            'related NASDR proceeding against CSFB; (3) orders a civil penalty '
            'of $30 million pursuant to Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act, '
            "which would be reduced to $15 million in recognition of CSFB's "
            'payment of a $15 million penalty to NASDR in the related NASDR '
            'proceeding against CSFB; and (4) orders CSFB to comply with '
            'certain undertakings discussed below.  \n'
            'As part of the settlement, CSFB has undertaken to establish a '
            'broad range of new policies and procedures relating to IPO '
            'allocations to prevent a recurrence of the misconduct described '
            'in the Complaint.  Among the undertakings to which CSFB has '
            'consented, the firm will implement extensive new policies and '
            'procedures relating to the allocation of IPO shares, the account '
            'opening process, commission levels, and supervisory practices.  '
            'The new policies include a prohibition against the following '
            'conduct:  (1) making a wrongful arrangement or a wrongful quid '
            'pro quo of any kind with customers in exchange for IPO '
            'allocations; and (2) improper sharing of profits or losses with a '
            'customer who receives an IPO allocation or allocations.  CSFB '
            'also has agreed to retain an Independent Consultant to conduct a '
            'review to provide reasonable assurance of the implementation and '
            'effectiveness of its new policies and procedures.  This review '

{'content': 'On January 14, 2002, the Honorable Phillip M. Pro issued final '
            'judgments of permanent injunction against World Homes, Inc., '

            'enjoining them from future violations of the securities '

            'Secretary-Treasurer, was enjoined from future violations of the '

            "the orders without admitting or denying the Commission's "
            'allegations.  Ferguson was also ordered to pay a civil money '
            'penalty in the amount of $120,000.\n'
            'The Complaint alleges that from approximately January 2000 '
            'through February 2001, World Homes, through Ferguson, distributed '
            'several false and misleading press releases misrepresenting, '

            'Homes operated and maintained a production facility for its '
            'cement product; 2) that World Homes had obtained financing loans '
            'of fifteen million dollars; and 3) that World Homes had generated '
            'over $480 million in contracted business.  These false press '
            'releases resulted in an increase in the price of World Homes= '
            'common stock and an increase in the volume of shares traded on '
            'the OTC Bulletin Board.  In doing so, the complaint alleges World '

            'III, age 38, a resident of Torrance, California and former '
            'Controller for Rustic Canyon Group.  The complaint alleges that '
            'Wooten obtained material nonpublic information during his '
            'employment for Rustic Canyon Group regarding the 2000 acquisition '
            'of Times Mirror Company by the Tribune Company, and that he used '

            'Also on January 22, 2002, the United States Attorney for the '
            'Central District of California filed criminal charges against '
            "Wooten based on the same conduct alleged in the Commission's "
            'complaint.  Wooten has agreed to plead guilty to the charges.\n'
            "The Commission's complaint alleges that on or about March 6, "
            '2000, Wooten learned that the Tribune Company planned to acquire '
            'Times Mirror Company.  The complaint alleges that Wooten acquired '
            'this information at a meeting he attended at Rustic Canyon Group, '
            'a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm hired to assist in the '
            'acquisition.  Wooten was informed that the planned acquisition of '
            'Times Mirror was not yet public during this meeting.  On March '
            '13, 2000, Times Mirror and Tribune publicly announced their '
            'merger agreement.  The price of Times Mirror stock rose 37 11/16 '
            'per share or 78% on news of the announcement.  The complaint '
            'further alleges that on March 8, 2000, and on March 10, 2000, '
            'Wooten purchased a total of 2,285 shares of Times Mirror stock, '
            'ultimately realizing illegal profits of over $76,000.  Wooten has '
            "admitted the allegations set forth in the Commission's "

            'injunction barring him from committing further violations of '
            'Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.\n'
            'The complaint does not seek disgorgement from Wooten of his '
            'insider trading profits because he agreed to pay restitution, in '

{'content': 'On September 29, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission '
            'charged a former executive at Life Time Fitness Inc., a middleman '
            'tipper, and six traders with insider trading ahead of the '
            'announcement that the company would be purchased and taken '
            'private.\n'
            'In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern '
            'District of Illinois, the SEC alleges that Shane P. Fleming, a '
            'former vice president of sales at Life Time Fitness, learned of '
            'the merger discussions on or before Feb. 23, 2015 and tipped his '
            'friend and business partner Bret J. Beshey with the understanding '
            'that Beshey would use the information to make a profit and split '
            'those profits with Fleming.  The SEC alleges that rather than '
            'trade in his own name, Beshey tipped his friends Christopher M. '
            'Bonvissuto and Peter A. Kourtis with the understanding that both '
            'men would kick back a portion of their trading proceeds to '
            "Beshey.  According to the SEC's complaint, Kourtis tipped his "
            'friends Alexander T. Carlucci, Dimitri A. Kandalepas, Austin C. '
            'Mansur, and Eric L. Weller, and asked Carlucci, Mansur, and '

            'trading on the information, which they agreed to do.\n'
            'The SEC alleges that the six traders purchased a total of '
            'approximately 2,000 highly speculative out-of-the-money call '
            'options for Life Time Fitness shares and sold those options for '
            'profits of approximately $866,209 shortly after a newspaper '
            'reported that Life Time Fitness was in advanced merger '
            'discussions with two private equity firms.  According to the '
            "SEC's complaint, Bonvissuto and Kourtis shared a portion of their "
            'profits with Beshey, who gave approximately $10,000 in cash to '
            'Fleming.  The SEC also alleges that Carlucci and Mansur paid cash '
            'kickbacks to Kourtis, and that Weller gave Kourtis at least 10 '
            'pounds of marijuana as a kickback.\n'

            'Meli was arrested in January 2017 and later pleaded guilty to '

            "signatures that claimed to show Meli's company had agreements "
            'with various production and management companies to purchase '

            'for the bulk purchase and resale of tickets to popular Broadway '
            'shows and concerts, but used the majority of the more than $97 '

            'enrich Meli, his family, and a co-defendant.  On April 26, 2017, '
            'the court entered a preliminary injunction and asset freeze '
            'against Meli and his co-defendants in that matter.  In the second '
            'action, the SEC alleged that Meli and New York sports radio '

            'falsely claiming that they had access to large blocks of '

{'content': 'On September 28, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission '
            'charged three New York-based brokers with making unsuitable '
            'recommendations that resulted in substantial losses to customers '

            'customers would profit.  According to the complaint, since '
            'customers incur costs with every transaction, the price of the '
            'security must increase significantly during the brief period it '
            'is held in an account for even a minimal profit to be realized.\n'
            'The SEC further alleges that Gennity and Roveccio churned '

            'customer losses totaled $683,038 while Gennity and Roveccio '
            'received approximately $280,000 and $206,000, respectively, in '
            'commissions and fees.\n'
            "The SEC's order against Torres finds that he had no reasonable "
            'basis to believe it was suitable to recommend a high-cost pattern '
            'of frequent trading that gave his customers virtually no chance '
            'of making even a minimal profit.  Torres also engaged in churning '
            'and made unauthorized trades.  Without admitting or denying the '
            'findings, Torres agreed to be barred from the securities industry '
