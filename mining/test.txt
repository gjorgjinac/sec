{'content': 'On January 4, 2019, the United States District Court for the '
            'Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment by default '
            'against relief defendant Edward H. Forte in an SEC enforcement '
            'action.  In March 2017, the Commission charged Daniel H. Glick, a '
            'Chicago-based investment adviser, and his unregistered investment '
            'advisory firm, Financial Management Strategies Inc. (FMS), with '
            'misappropriating millions from elderly investors.  The complaint '
            'named Forte as a relief defendant, alleging that he received more '
            'than $1 million of the money that had been misappropriated from '
            'Glick.\n'
            "According to the SEC's complaint, Glick and FMS provided clients "
            "with false account statements that hid Glick's improper use of "
            'client funds to pay personal expenses and his improper transfers '
            'of funds to Forte and another individual.  The SEC further '
            'alleged that Glick sent more than $1 million to Forte or to '
            "third-parties for Forte's benefit.\n"
            'The final judgment against Forte orders him to pay disgorgement '
            'of $1,013,637, representing money he received as a result of '
            "Glick's and FMS's violations alleged in the Complaint, along with "
            'prejudgment interest of $30,633, for a total of $1,044,270.\n'
            'On January 9, 2018, Glick pled guilty to one count of wire fraud '
            'in a related criminal action, United States v. Daniel Glick, No. '
            '17-CR-739.  On April 17, 2018, Glick was sentenced to 151 months '
            'imprisonment, and ordered to pay $5.2 million in restitution.  '
            'The criminal case arises from substantially the same conduct '
            "alleged in the SEC's enforcement action.  On September 19, 2018, "
            'the Court in the SEC action entered final judgments against '
            'Glick, FMS and relief defendant Glick Accounting Services, Inc. '
            '(GAS), which included permanent injunctions against Glick and FMS '
            'and repatriation orders against Glick, FMS and GAS.\n'

            'charges against Texas resident and real estate developer Phillip '
            'Michael Carter, two other individuals, and several related '
            'entities for conducting a multi-million dollar offering fraud.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint alleges that Carter, along with Bobby Eugene "
            'Guess and Richard Tilford, raised almost $45 million from over '
            '270 investors across the United States by selling short-term, '
            'high-yield promissory notes issued by a number of shell companies '
            'intentionally named to confuse investors. The complaint alleges '
            'that Carter, Guess, and Tilford claimed to offer investments in '
            "Carter's legitimate real estate development companies, which were "
            'purportedly backed by hard assets from actual real estate '
            'development projects.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the '
            'individual defendants sold securities issued by unrelated, but '
            'closely-named, entities that had no assets.  Carter then '
            'misappropriated investor funds to pay $1.2 million towards a '
            'personal IRS tax lien, operate a luxury hunting ranch, fund his '
            'lifestyle, and make over $3 million in Ponzi payments to '

            'Forty Development Capital Account, with violating the antifraud '

            'Development LLC, Texas Cash Cow, LLC f/k/a Texas Cash Cow '
            'Investments, LLC, and Texas First Financial, LLC, with violating '

            'Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) '

            'violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) '
            'of the Securities Act. Separately, Guess and Tilford are also '
            'charged with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions '
            'of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. The SEC is seeking relief '

            'conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, '
            'and civil penalties.  The SEC is also requesting disgorgement and '
            'prejudgment interest from the four relief defendants.  The SEC '
            "also requested that the Court freeze Carter's assets, order him "
            'to give an accounting, and issue him a document preservation '
            'order.\n'
            'In related criminal proceedings pursued by the Texas State '

{'content': 'The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on January 15, '
            '2019 charges against nine defendants for participating in a '
            "previously disclosed scheme to hack into the SEC's EDGAR system "
            'and extract nonpublic information to use for illegal trading.  '
            'The SEC charged a Ukrainian hacker, six individual traders in '
            'California, Ukraine, and Russia, and two entities.  The hacker '
            'and some of the traders were also involved in a similar scheme to '
            'hack into newswire services and trade on information that had not '
            'yet been released to the public.  The SEC charged the hacker and '
            'other traders for that conduct in 2015 (see Press Release No. '

            'attention to EDGAR and, using deceptive hacking techniques, '
            'gained access in 2016.  Ieremenko extracted EDGAR files '
            'containing nonpublic earnings results.  The information was '

            'between when the files were extracted from SEC systems and when '
            'the companies released the information to the public.  In total, '
            'the traders traded before at least 157 earnings releases from May '
            'to October 2016 and generated at least $4.1 million in illegal '
            'profits.\n'
            "The SEC's complaint alleges that Ieremenko circumvented EDGAR "
            'controls that require user authentication and then navigated '
            'within the EDGAR system.  Ieremenko obtained nonpublic "test '
            'files," which issuers can elect to submit in advance of making '
            'their official filings to help make sure EDGAR will process the '
            'filings as intended.  Issuers sometimes elected to include '
            'nonpublic information in test filings, such as actual quarterly '
            'earnings results not yet released to the public.  Ieremenko '

            'least June 2018, Joseph A. Meyer, Jr., and Statim Holdings, Inc. '
            'offered and sold four classes of limited partnership interests in '
